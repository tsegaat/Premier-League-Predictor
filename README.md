# Premier League Predictor 

Premier League Predictor is an app that predicts soccer games given the half-time statistics of the game.

There is a GUI and a Non-GUI version of the app available in this repo. It was built using the python language and TensorFlow framework.

## Prerequisites 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). If you want to use the GUI version you will need to install [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) too.

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.5 numpy pandas
pip install pillow
```

## Usage
Run the main.py file located in both the GUI and Non-GUI folders to run the application. Make sure to run it with the environment you configured the packages with.
